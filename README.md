Repository on how to install and use [thundersvm](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm) along with associated advantages and speedup comparison with [scikit-learn svm](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html). 

I have written a Medium article explaining these [here](https://medium.com/@sifat.abdullah577/how-to-install-and-run-thundersvm-in-google-colab-de1fe49eef85).

Thundersvm speeds up all functions of support vector classification which can be seen below.
